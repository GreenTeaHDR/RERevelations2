<br>**Description**


This mod replaces XBox button prompts with PlayStation DualShock controller prompts.


Additionally, this mod also modifies the blood overlay shown when you're hit in a way that is less intrusive.

Because of the way this game processes the colors of the button textures, it took quite a while to get the results I wanted.
There's still room for improvements probably, but with things getting in the way IRL that may be a while.

**Usage:**


Extract 'nativePCNext' to your Resident Evil Revelations 2 installation folder, overwriting existing files.


Note: If you use the widescreen/Fusion fix, ensure that DisableDamageOverlay is set to 0.
You can find this option in the ResidentEvilRevelations2.FusionFix.ini file.

If you're planning to use upscaled texture packs, make sure you add this AFTER adding the texture replacement.
